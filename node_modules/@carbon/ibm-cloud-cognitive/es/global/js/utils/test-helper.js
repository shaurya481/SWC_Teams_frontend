/**
 * A helper function to mock properties of the HTML element prototype.
 * @param {*} options An object containing one or more properties, being the
 * names of properties to add/replace in the HTML element prototype along with
 * a property descriptor to apply. The property descriptor may contain a value
 * field, and optionally a writable flag, or it may contain a get and/or a set
 * method. Other property descriptor fields may also be included, but each
 * mocked property will always be made configurable (in order to enable the
 * mock to be restored later).
 * @returns An object containing a mockRestore function which will return all
 * replaced properties to their original states and remove all added properties.
 * This function should be called after tests in order not to pollute other
 * tests with the installed mocks.
